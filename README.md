A free, open-source mission planner for DJI drones. Plan waypoint missions on an interactive map, tweak flight parameters, and export KMZ files ready to fly.

![DroneRoute — Mission planner with waypoints, configuration panel, and elevation chart](docs/screenshots/main-map.png)

## Features

- **Interactive map** — Click to place waypoints and Points of Interest on OpenStreetMap
- **Waypoint configuration** — Set altitude, speed, gimbal pitch, heading mode, and turn mode per waypoint
- **Points of Interest** — Define POIs and auto-point the camera toward them
- **Smart gimbal pitch** — Automatically calculates the optimal gimbal angle based on distance and height to a POI
- **Waypoint actions** — Add photo, video, gimbal rotate, yaw, hover, zoom, and focus actions
- **KMZ export & import** — Generates DJI WPML-compliant KMZ files, or load existing ones
- **Upload to controller** — Push KMZ files directly to USB-connected DJI RC controllers with `npx droneroute`
- **Save & load** — Persist missions to a local database with user accounts
- **Share missions** — Generate a read-only link to share any saved route; recipients can preview stats, open in the editor, clone to their account, or export the KMZ directly
- **Mission templates** — Orbit, grid survey, facade scan, and pencil path presets to get you flying faster
- **Animated flight path** — Dashed lines animate in flight direction, proportional to each waypoint's speed
- **Drag-and-drop reordering** — Reorder waypoints by dragging in the sidebar
- **Keyboard shortcuts** — `W` add waypoint, `P` add POI, `Z` pencil path, `Esc` deselect, `Delete` remove selected
- **Self-hosted** — Run it on your own machine or server with Docker

## Supported Drones

DJI M300 RTK, M350 RTK, M30/M30T, Mavic 3E/3T/3M/3D/3TD, Mini 4 Pro.

## Getting Started

You'll need **Node.js 22+** and **npm 10+**.

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/fcsonline/droneroute.git
cd droneroute

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build the shared types package (required before first run)
npm run build -w packages/shared

# Start both backend and frontend in dev mode
npm run dev
```

That's it! Open `http://localhost:5173` and start planning missions.

### Docker

Prefer Docker? One command:

```bash
docker run -d -p 3001:3001 -v droneroute-data:/app/data fcsonline/droneroute:latest
# Open http://localhost:3001
```

A [docker-compose.yml](docker-compose.yml) with Traefik reverse proxy is also available in the repo.

### Self-hosted limitations

The self-hosted version is designed as a single-account, personal instance. Mission sharing is hidden since share links require your instance to be publicly reachable.

### Default map location

By default the map opens centered on Barcelona. Set `DEFAULT_MAP_VIEW` (in your `.env` or `docker-compose.yml`) to make the map open on your local area instead. The format is `lat,lng` or `lat,lng,zoom` — for example `DEFAULT_MAP_VIEW=51.5072,-0.1276,12`. See [.env.example](.env.example) for the accepted ranges.

## Upload to Your DJI Controller

After exporting a KMZ file, push it directly to a USB-connected DJI RC controller:

```bash
npx droneroute mission.kmz
```

The CLI detects connected controllers (via adb or mounted SD cards), creates a new mission slot, and places the file. See the [droneroute CLI docs](packages/cli/README.md) for details and prerequisites.

| Shared         | TypeScript types package shared between frontend and backend               |
| Infrastructure | Docker, Traefik, SQLite                                                    |

The project is organized as an npm monorepo with four packages: `shared`, `backend`, `frontend`, and `cli`.
